I am currently a PhD student in computer graphics at [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr/) laboratory in France since October 2021. My thesis is about virtual worlds authoring and creation. Virtual worlds are frequently used in the entertainment industry (video games, movies) to provide users with a unique and extraordinary experience. My work focuses on application of deep-learning methods to the creation or edition of natural landscapes, terrain, vegetation and all elements composing a virtual world, in order to facilitate artists' workflow. 

I am part of the [Ampli project](https://projet.liris.cnrs.fr/ampli/posts/) (*Learning and Inverse Procedural Modeling for Authoring Large Virtual Worlds*) which aims to propose high-level techniques to assist artists. This project is in collaboration with Ubisoft Paris and the CIRAD. 
Within the LIRIS, I am a member of the research team [Arches](https://arches.liris.cnrs.fr/).
